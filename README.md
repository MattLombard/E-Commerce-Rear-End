# E-commerce Rear End

## Description

This application is the back end part of an online shopping website. It uses Express.js and Sequelize to help the website talk to a MySQL database easily. Express.js is a tool that makes it simple to build the back part of websites, while Sequelize helps manage the information in the database. Insomnia is another tool used in this setup that lets developers test and improve the way the website communicates with the database. In summary, using Express.js, Sequelize, and Insomnia together makes the online shopping website work better and creates a smooth experience for users.
